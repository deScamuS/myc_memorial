                  It will be presented to the top crew in any fleet or event
                  that is held at Minnetonka Yacht Club in the year it is
                  awarded. A crew member could also be a helper at a social
                  event, like a regatta or other significant event hosted by
                  The Minnetonka Yacht Club.
                  <p>
              Fleets and fleet captains will be advised to recommend people who
              should be considered for this award. A recommendation along with
              why they should win the award will be submitted to MYC for an
              eventual winner. It will be awarded annually at the
              Minnetonka Yacht Club Banquet.

            <p>
              The model is of the first A, the 1986 Melges, not the 2003 hull.
              They look the same from a galloping horse, but there are clear
              differences to those of us who sailed on or against both of them,
              notably the vang configuration, the boomkin, and the rudders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The model shows the 1986 hull in her 1986 livery, when she was
              configured with symmetrical(conventional) spinnakers; she was
              later modified in 1996 with a bowsprit, to carry asymmetrical
              spinnakers. The 1986 hull was also the first in the national fleet
              to convert to foil shaped, high aspect ratio rudders. That
              modification had several iterations (they kept breaking off), and
              took place about 1990. The model was made by Kyle Metzloff, of
              Madison, Wisconsin. Unlike the Stu Lemon models (hand carved), the
              Metzloff crafting was done with a CNC milling machine, with
              excruciatingly correct detail.

            <h4>Let's start with a story...</h4>
            
            <p>
              On one particularly windy day, the normal 
              races were cancelled due to high winds.  We decided that we would race the two boats around Big Island...we were adventurous. 
Gary was on the A boat with 7 people, and Cheryl was on my E boat with 5 people.  This is a very large crew for 
the E boat, never ever had this many people on board.  

Fun fact, she was pregnant with Rachel, which will tell 
you how long ago this happened.  A huge puff came out of the Northwest as we were sailing up the bay towards Big Island. 
Wind was pretty much out of the Crystal Bay neighborhood where Sailors World was located.  We watched as it hit the A boat ahead of us and laughed 
as they almost flipped it.  Then it hit us.  We went over, and capsized very quickly.  When I went under the boat in the water to check the lines, my main 
sheet was still cleated hard in the Harken block...it was my fault that we rolled.
Tom Traff was watching over us and came immediately to our/Cheryl's rescue.  It was like he didn't even acknowledge the 
rest of us in the water. Too funny.  We all knew that Cheryl was pregnant, and Tom was shouting "Cheryl! Cheryl!  - Can we 
bring you on board".  We all survived, although my ego was a little bruised.   Cheryl made it, and so did Rachel, so technically 
we had 6 people on board the E boat that day.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
              Gary and Charyl DeSantis - owners/operators of Sailors World
              Marina and Boat Club on Smiths Bay, where many members filled their gas tanks and
              purchased sailboats, had become well known and
              loved throughout the community... and with 5 lunatic kids in tow
              they strived to keep Sailors World a place for all to feel welcome
              and important. <br/>  
              Gary was a long standing crew as a main sail/spinnaker trimmer on Willie Crear's many Ascows with some pretty cool stories - like when my dad climbed the Ascow mast to the spreaders in the middle of a race and peed on Willie and the crew :)
              Gary and wife Cheryl also crewed on Dan Crears' "E" boat and raced at Wayzata Club quite a
              bit. Cheryl was also a crew, and was best know for
              her willingness to help out with social events and parties
              throughout her life. Always the first to jump in and help.

            <h2><strong>Brad Robinson</strong></h2>
            <p>
              Brad Robinson sailed his last race on October 17, 2015, leaving
              behind an enduring legacy of honor, passion and generosity to the
              sailing community he loved.

            <img src="img/victory2.jpg" />
          </br>
          <p>In 1949 Robinson enrolled at Minnetonka Sailing School, where he was involved for the
   rest of his life as a student, instructor, chairman and board member, growing alongside it. His Scow sailing career spanned nearly 
   seven decades.</p>
          <p>
            Brad Robinson was a scow sailor... Growing up on the shores of Lake
            Minnetonka, he discovered his passion at a young age and spent much
            of his competitive sailing career developing ways to improve the
            performance of his sailboats. In retirement, this drive for
            advancement in sailboat design and technology led him to establish
            Victory By Design, LLC. He then built Victory, a class legal A Scow,
            to be the proof boat for his real dream of a totally carbon fiber
            ultra light V38: InnoVation.
          </p>
         <br/>
          <p>
            An integral member of the InnoVation racing crew, Susana mans the
            tender boat for every race, always ready with supplies and extra
            crew. She and the crew plan to continue sailing InnoVation to honor
            Brad's legacy. Susana will also continue using their tender boat to
            support Jud Dayton’s A Scow, Instigator.
